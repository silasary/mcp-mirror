INTRODUCTION

This is an MCP/2.1 package written for the JHCore MCP/2.1 implementation
for MOO.

You can find out more about MCP/2.1 here:

    http://www.awns.com/mcp/

The package dns-com-awns-serverinfo provides the client with a pair
or URLs, the web pages for the server's designated home page and
online help page, if such exist.  The client can make these URLs
available from its own Help menu, or from a Function Key or a big
glossy 'Help!!' button.

The client should not pop-open a webbrowser as soon as it receives
the dns-com-awns-serverinfo message however, leave that action up
to the user.  A package like dns-com-awns-displayurl is better for
providing URLs to the client to be displayed immediately.


Client to Server messages

dns-com-awns-serverinfo-get

    usually sent by the client after the MCP negotiation phase,
    the server should respond with a dns-com-awns-serverinfo
    message.


Server to Client messages

dns-com-awns-serverinfo home_url: STR <URL of Home Page>
                        help_url: STR <URL of Help Page>

INSTALL

As a non-wizard user port the MOO-code in the file dns-com-awns-serverinfo.moo.
You'll need to load the file into a text editor and use search and
replace functions to replace the following strings with their
relevant values:

    __PACKAGE__		object id of generic MCP package
    __NEW__		object id of newly @create'd package
    __REGISTRY__	object id of $mcp.registry

To add the package to the MCP Registry, become a wizard and type:

    @add-package __NEW__ to __REGISTRY__

The package should be detected by your client the next time you
connect to the MOO.

To set the Home Page and Help Page URLs type:

    @set __NEW__.home_url to "http://www.someplace.foo/"
    @set __NEW__.help_url to "http://www.someplace.foo/help"

Either property may also be left blank, set to "", to signify that
no URL is available.
