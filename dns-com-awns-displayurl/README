INTRODUCTION

This is an MCP/2.1 package written for the JHCore MCP/2.1 implementation
for MOO.

You can find out more about MCP/2.1 here:

    http://www.awns.com/mcp/

The package dns-com-awns-displayurl allows the server to send URLs
to the client.  The client should then use a client-side webbrowser
to display the contents of the URL.  The client can optionally
display a warning message to the user requesting if the URL should
be displayed.

The package sends a single message:

S->C    #$#dns-com-awns-displayurl <authkey> url: <a URL>

The MOO implementation contains the following useful API calls:

    package:send_(session, url)

	send the message dns-com-awns-displayurl to the client.
	the parameter 'url' is a string containing a fully qualified
	URL, which will be passed to a client-side webbrowser.
	the package doesn't check to see if the URL is valid, and
	all error conditions are assumed to be handled by the
	client-side webbrowser.

    package.trusted

	a list of objects which are trusted to make calls to the
	:send_(...) verb.  :send_(...) checks this list, by calling
	package:trusts(caller), and if caller is in .trusted then
	allows the message to be sent.  if .trusted is the empty
	list then any object can make calls to :send_(...)

INSTALL

As a non-wizard user port the MOO-code in the file dns-com-awns-displayurl.moo.
You'll need to load the file into a text editor and use search and
replace functions to replace the following strings with their
relevant values:

    __PACKAGE__		object id of generic MCP package
    __NEW__		object id of newly @create'd package
    __REGISTRY__	object id of $mcp.registry

To add the package to the MCP Registry, become a wizard and type:

    @add-package __NEW__ to __REGISTRY__

The package should be detected by your client the next time you
connect to the MOO.
