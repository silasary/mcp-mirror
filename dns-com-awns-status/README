INTRODUCTION

This is an MCP/2.1 package written for the JHCore MCP/2.1 implementation
for MOO.

You can find out more about MCP/2.1 here:

    http://www.awns.com/mcp/

The package dns-com-awns-status allows the server to send short,
human readable, informational messages to cooperating clients.  The
client can display the message in a number of ways.  For example
on the main chat screen, or in a special part of the client's status
bar or log window.  The client is free to ignore the message
completely if it wishes.

dns-com-awns-status has one message 'dns-com-awns-status' sent from
the server to the client.  The message has a single keyword-value
pair 'text'.  An example message is:

    #$#dns-com-awns-status <authkey> text: "Hello world!"

On receipt of this message the client should display 'Hello world!'.

Example uses:

o   periodic timestamps
o   user connection and disconnection messages (like the login
    watcher)

INSTALL

As a non-wizard user port the MOO-code in the file dns-com-awns-status.moo.
You'll need to load the file into a text editor and use search and
replace functions to replace the following strings with their
relevant values:

    __PACKAGE__		object id of generic MCP package
    __NEW__		object id of newly @create'd package
    __REGISTRY__	object id of $mcp.registry

To add the package to the MCP Registry, become a wizard and type:

    @add-package __NEW__ to __REGISTRY__

The package should be detected by your client the next time you
connect to the MOO.
