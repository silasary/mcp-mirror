A repo containing as much info as I can still find of MUD Client Protocol packages

So many pieces of spec have disappeared over the past 5 years, and while working on [Mongoose's new web-client](https://github.com/MongooseMoo/react-client/), I found myself needing to hit archive.org far too much.

So I've made this repo to gather a centralized repo of everything I could find/recover from various sources
