'Installing' this package is very easy.
First you replace the following tokens with the corresponding
object numbers:
  __PACKAGE__  -> The generic MCP-package
  __MMEDIA__   -> The number of the freshly created package
  __REGISTRY__  -> The MCP registry ($mcp.registry)

Then you merely dump the package using your designated MCP-player and
add it to the registry using '@add-package __MMEDIA__ to __REGISTRY__'.
No wizardly perms or changes to the core are required for this package.
