INTRODUCTION

This is an MCP/2.1 package written for the JHCore MCP/2.1 implementation
for MOO.

You can find out more about MCP/2.1 here:

    http://www.awns.com/mcp/

The package dns-com-awns-jtext allows the client to access jtext
links.  Jtext is a hypertext format for the JHCore and this package
provides an MCP/2.1 version of the MCP/1.0 'jtext-pick' message.

It's likely that this package will be renamed to something like
'dns-org-mud-moo-jtext' at some time in the future.

The package one message:

    C->S    #$#dns-com-awns-jtext-pick <authkey> address-type: <type> args: <arguments>

The package assumes the presence of a Jtext API in the core, right
now this means just existing JHCore MOOs will be able to make use
of the package.

INSTALL

As a non-wizard user port the MOO-code in the file dns-com-awns-ping.moo.
You'll need to load the file into a text editor and use search and
replace functions to replace the following strings with their
relevant values:

    __PACKAGE__		object id of generic MCP package
    __NEW__		object id of newly @create'd package
    __REGISTRY__	object id of $mcp.registry

To add the package to the MCP Registry, become a wizard and type:

    @add-package __NEW__ to __REGISTRY__

The package should be detected by your client the next time you
connect to the MOO.
